# Mapping how music induces emotional changes.

## Predicting initial moods and visualizing induced emotional changes throughout a user’s music streaming experience.

- The LJ2M dataset/study is used to predict the context emotions of users listening to different types of music, accounting in factors such as preferences, activities and related emotions.
- Different emotions from the study are mapped to the GEMS scale to simplify the measurement of emotions.
- References from this study of perceived and induced emotional responses are used to visualize a prediction of induced emotional changes, categorized by labels used on the valence-arousal scale.
